# Docker-Compose to PlantUML

## Goal

Generate a plantuml file that describe docker services and their dependencies, based on a given `docker-compose.yaml` file.

## Output

The result is written in stdout, with the following pattern :

```plantuml
@startuml

package <-Dpackage=value> {
    component1

    component2 --> component3
    component2 --> component4

    ...
}

@enduml
```
